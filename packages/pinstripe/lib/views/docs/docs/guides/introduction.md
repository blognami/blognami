# Introduction

Pinstripe is a Node.js based CMS, that can be stripped back to a general purpose web framework.

## Quick Start

To see it in action run the following:

```bash
    yarn global add pinstripe
    pinstripe generate-project foo
    cd foo
    pinstripe init-database
    pinstripe start-server
```

Now go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and it should be up and running.
