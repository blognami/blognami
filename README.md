## ❓ What is Blognami?

Blognami is **both an app and a framework stack**:

* **Blognami** → The blogging platform itself — passwordless authentication, markdown editing, tagging, and more.
* **Pinstripe** → The underlying full-stack web framework powering Blognami.
  It provides the core runtime, database integration, and CLI commands used to create, run, and manage Blognami projects.

This monorepo contains **all the packages for both Blognami and Pinstripe**, so you can explore the internals, contribute, or extend them.
